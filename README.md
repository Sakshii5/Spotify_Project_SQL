**Description**

This project is designed to perform data analysis on a relational database schema that manages various entities such as employees, customers, invoices, and media (tracks and albums). The goal is to provide insights and analytics based on the data stored in these tables.

**Data Source**

The data used in this project is sourced from Kaggle. It is a comprehensive dataset designed to simulate a real-world scenario involving various entities and their relationships. You can find the dataset here.

**Analysis Approach**

The project is segmented into three tiers of complexity: Easy, Moderate, and Advanced.

Easy Level: Features basic queries that focus on direct data retrieval, such as pinpointing top customers or employees.

Moderate Level: Encompasses intermediate queries that dig deeper, using complex JOIN operations, GROUP BY clauses, and aggregate functions like SUM and COUNT to derive more nuanced insights.

Advanced Level: Showcases the power of advanced SQL techniques. It prominently uses Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and window functions like RANK OR DENSE_RANK to answer complex queries.
